        I really wanted this to work! \
        Firstly it doesn't taste great but I was willing to keep using it in the hope I would get used to the taste and it did get easier as time went on. However one day I was brushing my teeth and a chunk of the bristles on my electric toothbrush came out. I thought it was weird but kept using it and the same thing happened again a couple of days later. I messaged Philips and interestingly they advised you shouldn't use natural toothpaste with electric toothbrushes as the oils in them can cause the bristles to come out. I personally wasn't willing to switch to a manual toothbrush to carry on using it (this isn't about being perfect it's about doing what you feel comfortable with). \
        Instead now I save up all our toothbrush / toothpaste waste including electric toothbrush heads and recycle it through Terracyle in partnership with @colgate ; they even take the cardboard boxes the toothpaste comes in which depending on where you read about it apparently can't be recycled normally. My local community food bank accepts them (I package it all in sealed sandwich bags) and they then get money back when they send it off to Terracycle - it's a win win! \
        My hope is that toothbrush packaging will before more eco friendly as time goes on but for now this is my personal solution üòä",
